While the previous chapter focussed on the network and the impact of application traffic on hardware vendors, network operators and users this chapter shifts focus on the application behaviour themselves.
The Internet supports a multitude of different applications, including video streaming services, online gaming, file storage services, cloud office solutions, etcetera.
In contrast to applications of earlier generations, todays' services are not standardised or under control by network operators but rather the result of free enterprise and entrepreneurship.
The interaction of such applications with the network and other players, e.g. cloud providers, are usually not considered by the application developers.
Deploying such applications can impact other stakeholders, e.g. \emph{Signalling Storms} interfering with the operation of mobile networks as discussed in \refsec{sec:network:network_traces}.
As this is of no consequence to application developers, they have no incentive to investigate the impact of their applications on other stakeholders.

In this chapter, we study the impact of two of the most prominent application types: Video streaming and file storage, chosen due to their impact on global traffic and frequency of use.
While in the last chapter we were able to rely on standard documents to model the systems under study, this option is no longer available when considering modern applications.
Thus, we perform measurements or take studies of other researchers into account in order to obtain knowledge of both the systems under study as well as the related stakeholders.

Similar to \refchap{chap:network}, we identify a set of involved stakeholders and their respective key performance indicators and derive corresponding metrics, as shown in \reffig{fig:application:stakeholders}.
First, we consider the \emph{application provider}. 
In the case of the video streaming scenario, this role is the part of the video provider.
We consider the video provider to be interested in two performance indicators: 
\begin{enumerate*}
\item user satisfaction, realised by a \gls{QoE} metric,
\item cost reduction in compute and network infrastructure.
\end{enumerate*}
In the case of the file synchronisation scenario, we consider the application operator to be interested in user satisfaction, again realised as a \gls{QoE} metric, the mean time to synchronisation.
Second, we consider the \emph{network operator}.
As in the last chapter, they are interested in reducing load on the network infrastructure, in order to prevent cases similar to Signalling Storms.
We measure this key performance indicator by considering the number of connections to the mobile network required to complete the synchronisation operation.
Similarly to \refchap{chap:network}, we assume that the \emph{user} is interested in both a high \gls{QoE} as well long battery life for the used device, sometimes also considered a \gls{QoE} metric~\cite{Ickin2012}, represented by the energy consumption metric. 

The contribution of this chapter is threefold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We provide models for video transmission mechanisms and perform a performance evaluation and tradeoff analysis considering metrics relevant to network operators, users, and video providers.
\item We provide a \gls{QoE} model for video streaming allowing for the analysis of heterogeneous user profiles and use this model in order to evaluate the impact of user preference on video streaming scenarios.
\item We propose a model for cloud file synchronisation and evaluate a set of scheduling mechanisms regarding impact of considered metrics for all stakeholders.
\end{enumerate}

The content from this chapter has been published in \cite{Schwartz2013b, Hossfeld2015, Schwartz2014a}.
In \refsec{sec:application:background} we discuss the current state of the art regarding video transmission mechanisms and \gls{QoE} studies.
Then, in \refsec{sec:application:lte_video} we discuss tradeoffs between different video transmission mechanisms, regarding the considered metrics.
In \refsec{sec:application:qoe_user_behaviour} we study the impact of user profiles on the \gls{QoE} experienced during video streaming.
In \refsec{sec:application:cloud_file_synchronisation} we consider the impact of different file synchronisation scheduling algorithms on the relevant stakeholders.
Finally, we discuss lessons learned in \refsec{sec:application:lessons_learned}.
