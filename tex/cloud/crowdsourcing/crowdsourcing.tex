While the last sections dealt with dimensioning of resources in machine cloud systems, similar methodologies are applicable to crowdsourcing, or human-clouds.
Here, a crowdsourcing platform operator enables employers to distribute microtasks to workers.
In order to ensure the success of the platform, the operator has to ensure the satisfaction of both the employers, as they provide the main source of income, as well as the workers, the resource of the platform.
This tradeoff between employer satisfaction, i.e. time required before submitted tasks are completed, and worker satisfaction, i.e. income, has to be managed by the platform operator by carefully considering the number of workers employed at the platform.

To this end, in \refsec{sec:cloud:crowdsourcing:model} we first provide a mode for crowdsourcing platforms regarding the two identified metrics.
Then, we study parameters of a real world crowdsourcing platform in \refsec{sec:cloud:crowdsourcing:measurements}.
Finally, in \refsec{sec:cloud:crowdsourcing:performance_evaluation} we evaluate the provided model using the obtained parameters and discuss the tradeoff between employer and worker satisfaction from the point of view of the platform operator.
