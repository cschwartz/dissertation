\chapter{Cloud}\label{chap:cloud}

In this chapter we consider tradeoffs which stakeholders face in cloud scenarios.
Traditionally, a cloud is a set of compute and network resources, which can be elastically rented by customers.
The recent rise of crowdsourcing platforms, also described as human cloud, it has become useful to refer to this type of cloud as \emph{machine cloud}, in order to better differentiate these two types of cloud.
The human cloud is based on the sample principles as the machine cloud, e.g. elasticity and reliability and enabled crowdsourcing employers to offer tasks to workers available on demand.
In this chapter we consider multiple scenarios:
First, we study the role of a cloud operator providing virtual resources to customers.
Then, we consider decisions faced by a user of a cloud who is deploying virtualised network functions in a cloud.
Finally, we investigate resource dimensioning in human clouds.
Regardless of the specific scenario, the number of resources available impact the \glspl{KPI} of all participating stakeholders, and is thus subject to optimisation.

We first provide an overview of the involved stakeholders and \glspl{KPI} in \reffig{fig:cloud:model}.
If we study the operation of a machine cloud, both the cloud operator and the cloud user need to be considered.
The cloud operator is interested in increasing revenue, i.e. attracting a high number of customers, and decrease financial expenditure, e.g. by reducing consumed energy.
The customer of a cloud operator is interested in good \glspl{SLA}, for example a low delay before processing of a job can begin.
In the second scenario, the network function operator taking the role of a customer in the previous scenario, is interested in provisioning a minimal number of resources from the cloud operator, in order to reduce cost, while in turn providing a sufficient \gls{SLA} to its customers.
The users of the virtualised network functions demand a sufficient availability of the provided service.
Finally, in case of the human cloud scenario, the cloud operator has to satisfy two stakeholders with conflicting interests.
On the one hand, employers are interested in a fast completion of the offered tasks.
On the other hand, workers are interested in obtaining a high income.
These goals are clearly conflicting, as fast completion can be obtained by providing a high number of available workers.
However, income per workers increases if the tasks are distributed between fewer workers.
Thus, the human cloud operator has to balance the interests of the two stakeholders.

The contribution of this chapter is threefold
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, we provide a model for energy efficient data centre operation and discuss sensible parameter configurations for the different stakeholders. 
\item Then, we study algorithms for resource provisioning on the example of a virtualised network function and evaluate their performance with respect to the demands of the stakeholders.
\item Finally, we model a crowdsourcing platform and provide guidelines for platform operators regarding resource acquisition.
\end{enumerate}

In \refsec{sec:cloud:related_work} we provide an overview of related work relevant to this chapter.
Then, in \refsec{sec:cloud:data_centers} we discuss the tradeoffs faced by a cloud operator.
We focus on the customer of a cloud operator in \refsec{sec:cloud:virtualized_network_functions} and discuss challenges when provisioning virtualised network functions.
Strategies for resource provisioning of a human cloud are considered in \refsec{sec:cloud:crowdsourcing}.
Finally, we provide lessons learned from our studies in \refsec{sec:cloud:lessons_learned}.
