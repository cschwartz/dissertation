\section{Data Centres}\label{sec:cloud:data_centers}
Data centres are used to host most of the applications running in the Internet, including those discussed earlier in this work.
Servers are operated by the data centre operator and rented out to customers as part of a \gls{PaaS} or \gls{IaaS} scheme.
In order to increase revenue the data centre operator is interested in decreasing server power drain, one of the major matters of expense for data centres \cite{Greenberg2009b}, while satisfying \glspl{SLA} with their customers.

This section studies this scenario and provides a model intended for data centre operators to manage this tradeoff.
In \refsec{sec:cloud:data_centers:problem_formulation} we provide a mathematical formulation for the considered scenario.
Then, in \refsec{sec:cloud:data_centers:modeling} we model this scenario using methods from queueing theory and present a closed form solution for the discussed queueing system in \refsec{sec:cloud:data_centers:closed_form_solution}.
Finally, in \refsec{sec:cloud:data_centers:performance_evaluation} we study the performance implications of the model and discuss the tradeoff between power drain and suffered waiting time.
