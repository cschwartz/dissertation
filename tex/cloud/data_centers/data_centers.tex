\section{Data Centers}\label{sec:cloud:data_centers}
Data centers are used to host most of the applications running in todays Internet, including those discussed earlier in this work.
Servers are operated by the data center operator and rented out to customers as part of a \gls{PaaS} or \gls{IaaS} scheme.
In order to increase revenue the data center operator is interested in decreasing server power consumption, one of the major matters of expense for data centers \cite{Greenberg2009b}, while satisfying \glspl{SLA} with their customers.

This section studies this scenario and provides a model intendent for data 	center operators to manage this trade-off.
In \refsec{sec:cloud:data_centers:problem_formulation} we provide a mathematical formulation for the considered scenario.
Then, in \refsec{sec:cloud:data_centers:modeling} we model this scenario using methods from queueing theory and present a closed form solution for the discussed queueing system in \refsec{sec:cloud:data_centers:closed_form_solution}.
Finally, in \refsec{sec:cloud:data_centers:performance_evaluation} we study the performance implicationf of the model and discuss the trade-off between energy consumption and suffered waiting time.
