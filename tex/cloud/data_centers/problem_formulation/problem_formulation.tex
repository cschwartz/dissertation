\subsection{Problem Formulation}\label{sec:cloud:data_centers:problem_formulation}

A widely used data center architecture is the three-tier architecture shown in \reffig{fig:sec:cloud:data_centers:problem_formulation:3-tier_datacenter}.
The upper two layers of the architecture are responsible for distributing the traffic and consist of layer 3 switches where each switch has a backup switch.
In this paper, we focus on the edge layer and here on a single \gls{POD}.
A \gls{POD} consists of a number of servers connected over top of rack switches to an aggregation switch.

We assume, that new jobs entering the system arrive with exponentially distributed inter-arrival time.
When a job in form of a packet arrives at the \gls{POD}, it is forwarded to an idle server.
If no idle server is available, the job is queued.
Once a server finishes processing its current job, it picks another one from the queue.

Our goal is now to evaluate how much power is consumed in a data center and how much can be saved when servers, not processing any job, are switched off.
Therefore, we developed two different data center models.
The first model, the \emph{default data center}, consists of two-state servers only which are either \emph{busy} or \emph{idle}, as shown in \reffig{fig:sec:cloud:data_centers:problem_formulation:servers:two_state}) 
For the second model, a more \emph{energy-efficient data center}, a subset of the servers may additionally be switched on and \emph{off} on demand, shown in \reffig{fig:sec:cloud:data_centers:problem_formulation:servers:three_state} as recommended in~\cite{EPA2007}.
