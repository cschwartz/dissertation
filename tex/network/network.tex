\chapter{Network}\label{chap:network}


traditional cell phones, traffic in networks largely dominated by voice traffic, to a smaller degree text and signalling messages
feature phones also introduced new types of traffic, mostly web traffic or, to a lesser extend, traffic generated by applications.
however, applications were either proprietary and designed by phone vendors or not particular widespread
introduction of smartphones resulted in an increased amount of applications, developed by a decentralized developer community.
with the application ecosystem no longer being under control of network operators, as in the case of voice or text messages, or hardware vendors, as with bundled applications in feature phones centralized end-to-end traffic engineering became difficult.
each of the stakeholders involved in the mobile landscape is interested in optimizing the network, device or application performance in its own interest.

this is especially due to the fact, that each of the 

this chapter is structured as follows.
first, we give an provide a background of mobile networks and survey the relevant related work in \refsec{sec:network:background}.
Then, we perform application traffic measurements and investigate the impact of application traffic on \gls{UE} power consumption, network signalling and web \gls{QoE} for a selected set of applications in \refsec{sec:network:network_traces}.
Finally, we generalize
