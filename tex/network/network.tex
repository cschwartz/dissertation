\chapter{Network}\label{chap:network}
This chapter studies trade-offs between multiple stakeholders in mobile networks.
These trade-offs have only appeared with the advent of smartphones.
With traditional cell phones, traffic in networks was largely dominated by voice traffic and to a smaller degree by text and signalling messages.
So called feature phones also introduced, together with new applications, new types of traffic.
Here, mostly web traffic and, to a lesser extend, traffic generated by applications was occuring.
However, applications were either proprietary and designed by phone vendors or did not find widespread adoption, so that the generated traffic was of note.
The introduction of smartphones resulted in an increased amount of applications, developed by a decentralized developer community.
With the application ecosystem no longer being under control of network operators, as in the case of voice or text messages, or hardware vendors, as with bundled applications in feature phones, centralized network management and end-to-end traffic engineering became difficult for network operators.

Each of the stakeholders involved in the mobile networking landscape is interested in optimizing the network, device, or application performance in its own interest.
To this end, each of the stakeholders can manipulate the parts of the network that it controls.
The network operator can change network configuration parameters in order to reduce signalling load in the network.
Smartphones may terminate data connections earlier, decreasing power consumption
Application developers can increase polling intervals in their application layer protocols in order to increase \gls{QoE}.	
However, each of the parameters the stakeholders can influence in order to optimize the metrics of their individual converns, also influences the complete system and thus all other metrics.

The contribution of this chapter is threefold.
\begin{enumerate*}
\item We provide an algorithm to key performance metrics for the considered stakeholders from traffic traces, and evaluate exemplary traces for a set of popular applications.
\item We develop an analytic model in order to analyse theoretical and empirical distributions and derive the metrics of interest for the stakeholders.
\item We study the impact of network timer optimisation, a practice where network operators modify network parameters in order to optimise signalling load, on a involved stakeholders.
\end{enumerate*}

The content of this chapter is taken from~\cite{Schwartz2013a,Schwartz2013c}.
Its remainder is structured as follows.
First, we give a background of mobile networks and survey the relevant related work in \refsec{sec:network:background}.
We perform application traffic measurements and investigate the impact of application traffic on \gls{UE} power consumption, network signalling and web \gls{QoE} for a selected set of applications in \refsec{sec:network:network_traces}.
Then, we generalize our results by introducing an analytic model in order to derive metrics for state transition frequency and power consumption from arbitrary traffic distributions in \refsec{sec:network:performance_model}.
Finally, we conclude this chapter with lessons learned in \refsec{sec:network:lessons_learned}.
