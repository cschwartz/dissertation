\chapter{Impact of Application Traffic on Mobile Infrastructure}\label{chap:network}
This chapter considers interactions between multiple stakeholders in future mobile networks and studies the resulting tradeoffs.
These tradeoffs have only appeared recently with the advent of smartphones.
With traditional cell phones, traffic in networks was largely dominated by voice traffic and to a smaller degree by text and signalling messages.
%So called feature phones introduced, together with the concept of mobile applications, new types of traffic.
%Here, mostly web traffic and, to a lesser extend, traffic generated by applications occurred.
%However, applications were either proprietary and designed by phone vendors or did not find widespread adoption, so that the generated traffic had little impact on the mobile network.
The introduction of smartphones resulted in an increased amount of applications, developed by a decentralized developer community.
With the application ecosystem no longer being under control of network operators, as in the case of voice or text messages, or hardware vendors, as with the rudamentary bundled applications of early feature phones, new types of network traffic occured and replaced voice and signalling as the main traffic type.
% centralized network management and end-to-end traffic engineering became difficult for network operators.
Furthermore, the amount of traffic is no longer the only performance indicator for the network operator, and the network operator is no longer the only stakeholder involved in the mobile network ecosystem.

Each of the stakeholders shown in \reffig{fig:network:stakeholders} is interested in optimising the network, device, or application performance in order to improve relevant \glspl{KPI}.
To this end, each of the stakeholders can manipulate the parts of the network that it controls.
The \emph{network operator} can change network configuration parameters in order to reduce \emph{signalling} in the network.
Hardware \emph{vendors} can configure smartphones in such a way that data connections are terminated as soon as possible, decreasing \emph{power drain}.
\emph{Application developers} can increase polling intervals in their application layer protocols in order to increase \emph{\gls{QoE}}.	
However, the parameters the stakeholders can influence in order to optimise the \gls{KPI} of their individual concerns, also influences the complete network and thus all other \glspl{KPI}, possible to the detriment of the other stakeholders.
When a stakeholder attempts to optimise \glspl{KPI} of interest, the consequences for other stakeholders have to be considered, as they could consider optimising their respective \glspl{KPI} in turn, resulting in a net loss for all participating stakeholders.
Thus, a tradeoff between all considered \glspl{KPI} is required in order to satisfy the participating stakeholders.

Current best practices result in each participant optimising the respective \glspl{KPI} individually, without adressing the needs of the other stakeholders~\cite{Qian2011a,NSN2011}.

The contribution of this chapter is threefold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We provide an algorithm to infer metrics for the relevant \glspl{KPI} for the stakeholders from traffic traces, and evaluate exemplary traces for a set of popular applications.
\item We develop an analytic model in order to analyse theoretical and empirical application traffic distributions and derive \glspl{KPI} for the stakeholders.
\item We study the impact of network timer optimisation, a practice where network operators modify network parameters in order to optimise signalling unilaterally, and show the impact for other stakeholders and highlight potential consequences for the network operator.
\end{enumerate}

The content of this chapter is taken from~\cite{Schwartz2013a,Schwartz2013c}.
Its remainder is structured as follows.
First, we give a background of mobile networks and survey related work in \refsec{sec:network:background}.
In \refsec{sec:network:network_traces}, we perform application traffic measurements and investigate the impact of application traffic on \gls{UE} power drain, network signalling and web \gls{QoE} for a selected set of applications.
Then, we generalize our results by introducing an analytic model in order to derive metrics for state transition frequency and power drain from arbitrary traffic distributions in \refsec{sec:network:performance_model}.
Finally, we conclude this chapter with lessons learned in \refsec{sec:network:lessons_learned}.
