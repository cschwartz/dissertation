\subsection{\headershortacr{UMTS} Networks and the \headershortacr{RRC} Protocol}\label{sec:network:background:umts_rrc}
A \gls{3G} \gls{UMTS} mobile network consists of three main components, which are depicted in \reffig{fig:network:background:mobile_network_overview}: The \gls{UE}, the \gls{RAN}, and the \gls{CN}.
The \gls{RAN} is used to establish connectivity between the \gls{UE} and the \gls{CN}, which in turn can establish connectivity to the Internet, if required.

\gls{UE} consists of devices used by end users, i.e. smartphones, tablets or data card enabled notebooks, but can also include \gls{M2M} devices.
The \gls{RAN} is, amongst other tasks, responsible for \gls{RRC}, packet scheduling and handover control.
It includes network entities such as the \gls{NodeB} and the \gls{RNC}.
The \gls{CN} provides the backbone network of the \gls{UMTS} network and provides connectivity to the Internet and the \gls{PSTN}.
Furthermore, functionality such as billing, authentication and location management is provided by the \gls{CN}.

In UMTS networks, the radio resources in the RAN between base station and UE are controlled and managed by the \gls{RRC} protocol~\cite{3GPP_RRC_Spec}.
The protocol offers services such as broadcast of network information, maintenance of a connection between the \gls{UE} and \gls{RAN}, establishment of point-to-point radio bearers for data transmission, \gls{QoS} control, and reporting and cell selection management.
The protocol is divided into different parts: services for upper layers, communication with lower layers, protocol states, \gls{RRC} procedures, and error control.
In particular, \gls{RRC} also participates in the co-ordination of other resource management operations such as channel measurements and handovers.
All \gls{RRC} procedures rely on protocol states which are defined to trigger action should be applied and which information must be signaled. 
The state are defined per \gls{UE} and for the connection between the \gls{UE} and the \gls{NodeB} station.
Typically there are five \gls{RRC} states characterizing a connection between \gls{UE} and \gls{NodeB}: \gls{idle}, \gls{URAPCH}, \gls{CELLPCH}, \gls{DCH}, and \gls{FACH}.
Whether a specific \gls{RRC} state is used in a specific mobile network depends on the configuration of the network by the provider.
In the following we concentrate on the most commonly observed~\cite{Qian2010} \gls{RRC} states \gls{idle}, \gls{DCH}, and \gls{FACH}.
