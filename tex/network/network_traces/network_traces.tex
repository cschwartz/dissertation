\section{Inferring Signalling Frequency and Power Consumption from Network Traces}\label{sec:network:network_traces}
All participating stakeholders, i.e. network operators, hardware vendors, and application developers, need to assess the impact of potential changes of parts of the mobile network, e.g. change of network parameters, introduction of new hardware or modification of applications, on their considered \glspl{KPI} without rolling out changes to the production network.
To this end, we propose specific metrics in order to quantify the impact of changes on the network on the considered \gls{KPI}.
We introduce an algorithm to infer metrics from application traffic measurements, network parameters and power and signalling configurations.
In \refsec{sec:network:network_traces:performance_evaluation} we present the algorithm and methods to describe the relevant metrics.
Then, in \refsec{sec:network:network_traces:numerical_results}, we use the proposed methodology to evaluate the impact of various network configurations on four popular applications.
