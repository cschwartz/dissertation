\section{A Performance Model for \glsentryshort{3G} \glsentryshort{RRC} States}\label{sec:network:performance_model}
The algorithm introduced in \refsec{sec:network:network_traces} can be used to infer the signalling frequency, power drain and \gls{QoE} of existing or prototyped applications.
However, in order to study the general impact of traffic in a comprehensive way, methods to derive said metrics from analytical traffic distributions are of interest.

In \refsec{sec:network:performance_model:analytical_model} we introduce a model allowing us to 
analyse both theoretical and empirical traffic models.
Then, in \refsec{sec:network:performance_model:numerical_examples} we use this model to study the impact of traffic characteristic on metrics, i.e. signalling intensity and power drain.
